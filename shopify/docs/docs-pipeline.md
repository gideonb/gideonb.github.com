FAQ
================


How do I create a MegaNav
---
The meganav will be created automatically if you have a dropdown menu that is nested more than two layers deep. TO nest menus, simply name a linklist with the same name you give to the link that should contain the dropdown.  Refer to this Shopify article for more thorough instructions: [https://docs.shopify.com/manual/your-website/navigation/create-drop-down-menu](https://docs.shopify.com/manual/your-website/navigation/create-drop-down-menu)

Why does my navigation switch to mobile
---
The pipeline navigation will switch to mobile when the links touch the logo.  If you have search enabled in the header, the expanded search field will be subtracted from the available menu space. To prevent your menu from switching on large screens you can nest menu items into a dropdown, disable search in the header, or move navigation items into the footer.

What size images should I use for products
---
Pipeline will work with images of any size and dimension, but it is recommended that you use product images with consistent dimensions, preferably squares.  For a smooth look, use non-white background-isolated images and set that color as the `Product Background Color` in the product page theme settings.  This will allow your product images to bleed into the background.

How do I add a navigation to the collection pages
---
Collections can have custom navigation using a nested link-list or standard navigation by collection, type, vendor, or tag.  To use a custom navigation, create a linklist in the Navigation portion of your admin, and select it as your `Custom Link List` in the Pipeline theme settings under Collection Pages.

How do I add a video to the top section
---
To add a video to the top section, just upload the video to Vimeo, then add it in the Home Page section of the Pipeline settings.
